# IDvsPDControlExperiment
Data needed to replicate Inverse Dynamics controller vs. PD controller in simulation
The gains for the PID controller at timestep 0.001 are in the file gains.dat
The controller gains for the ID controller at its three timesteps are in IDgains.dat
Currently, the function for the ID controller is commented out in sinusoidal-controller.cpp, to run the ID controller, comment the current PID controller function and uncomment the ID controller function
